--- HTML HOME ---
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
With HTML you can create your own website.

--- 1. HTML INTRODUCTION ---
WHAT IS HTML?
  - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
  - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
  - HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
  - HTML consists of a series of elements.
  - HTML elements tell the browser how to display content.
  - HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is heading", "this is
    paragraph", "this is a link"

EXAMPLE EXPLAINED
  - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
  - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
  - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
  - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser´s title bar or in the page´s tab).
  - The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for
    all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc...
  - The <h1> element defines a large heading.
  - The <p> element defines a paragraph.


--- 2. HTML BASIC ---
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers
to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page
(before any HTML tags). The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

  --- HTML headings ---
  HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most
  important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:

  <h1> This is heading 1</h1>
  <h2> This is heading 2</h2>
  <h3> This is heading 3</h3>

  --- HTML paragraphs ---
  HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
  <p> This is a paragraph </p>
  <p> This is another paragraph </p>

  --- HTML links ---
  HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

  The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used
  to provide additional information about HTML elements.

  --- HTML images ---
  HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
  The source file (src), alternative text (alt), and height are provided
  as attributes.

  <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="w3schools.com" width="104" height="142">


--- 3. HTML Elements ---
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

  --- HTML elements ---
  - The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
    <tagname> Content goes here ... </tagname>

  --- nested HTML elements ---
  - HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements)

  --- EMPTY HTML elements ---
  - HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
  - The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
  <p> This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>


--- 4. HTML Attributes ---
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

  --- HTML Attributes!---
  - All HTML elements can have attributes.
  - Attributes provide additional information about elements.
  - Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
  - Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

  --- The href attribute ---
  - The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL
    of the page the link goes to:

    < a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

  --- The src attribute ---
  - The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute
    specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
    <img src="img_girl.jpg">

    There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
    1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another
                      website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
      Notes: external images might be under copyright. if you do not get the
             permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws.
             In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be
             removed or changed.
    2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here,
                      the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins
                      without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.

  --- The width and height attributes ---
  - The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies
    the width of the image (in pixels):

    <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

  --- The alt attribute ---
  - The required "alt" attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternative text
    for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be
    due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user
    uses a screen reader.

    <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket."

  --- The style attribute ---
  - The "style" attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as colour,
  font, size, and much more.

  <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

  --- The lang attribute ---
  - You should always include the "lang" attribute inside the <html> tag, to
    declare the language of the WEB page. This is meant to assist search
    engines and browsers. Country codes can also be added to the language
    code in the "lang" attribute. So, the first two characters define the
    language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

    EXAMPLE:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">

  --- The title attribute ---
