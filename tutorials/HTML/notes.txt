--- HTML HOME ---
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
With HTML you can create your own website.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 1. HTML INTRODUCTION ---
---> "WHAT IS HTML?"
      - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
      - HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
      - HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
      - HTML consists of a series of elements.
      - HTML elements tell the browser how to display content.
      - HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is heading", "this is
       paragraph", "this is a link"

---> "EXAMPLE EXPLAINED"
      - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5
        document.
      - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
      - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
      - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown
        in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
      - The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for
        all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks,
        tables, lists, etc...
      - The <h1> element defines a large heading.
      - The <p> element defines a paragraph.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 2. HTML BASIC ---
---> "BASICS"
      - The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers
        to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page
        (before any HTML tags). The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

---> "HTML headings"
      - HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most
        important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:

        * EXAMPLE *

        <h1> This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2> This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3> This is heading 3</h3>

---> "HTML paragraphs"
      - HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
        * EXAMPLE *
        <p> This is a paragraph </p>
        <p> This is another paragraph </p>

---> "HTML links"
      - HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
      * EXAMPLE *
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

      - the link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used
        to provide additional information about HTML elements.

---> "HTML images"
      - HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
      - The source file (src), alternative text (alt), and height are provided
        as attributes.

        * EXAMPLE *
        <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="w3schools.com" width="104" height="142">


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 3. HTML Elements ---
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

---> "HTML elements"
      - The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
        <tagname> Content goes here ... </tagname>

---> "nested HTML elements"
      - HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements)

---> "EMPTY HTML elements"
      - HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
      - The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

        * EXAMPLE
        <p> This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 4. HTML Attributes ---
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

---> "HTML Attributes"
      - All HTML elements can have attributes.
      - Attributes provide additional information about elements.
      - Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
      - Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

---> "The href attribute"
      - The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL
        of the page the link goes to:

        * EXAMPLE *
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

---> "The src attribute"
      - The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute
        specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
        <img src="img_girl.jpg">

        There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
          1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another
             website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

          Notes: external images might be under copyright. if you do not get the
                 permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws.
                 In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be
                 removed or changed.
          2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here,
             the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins
             without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.

---> "The width and height attributes"
      - The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies
        the width of the image (in pixels):
        * EXAMPLE *
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

---> "The alt attribute"
      - The required "alt" attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternative text
        for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be
        due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user
        uses a screen reader.

        * EXAMPLE *
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket."

---> "The style attribute"
      - The "style" attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as colour,
        font, size, and much more.

        * EXAMPLE *
        <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

---> "The lang attribute"
      - You should always include the "lang" attribute inside the <html> tag, to
        declare the language of the WEB page. This is meant to assist search
        engines and browsers. Country codes can also be added to the language
        code in the "lang" attribute. So, the first two characters define the
        language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

        * EXAMPLE *
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en-US">

---> "The title attribute
      - The "title" attribute defines some extra information about an element.
      - The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you
        mouse over the element:

        * EXAMPLE *
        <p title="I'm a toooltip"> This is a paragraph.</p>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 5. HEADINGS ---
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

---> "HEADINGS ARE IMPORTANT":
      - search engines use the headings to index the structure and content
        of your web pages. It is important to use headings to show
        the document structure.

     "BIGGER HEADINGS"
      - each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size
        for any heading with the "style" attribute, using the CSS font-size
        property:

        * EXAMPLE *
        <h1 style="font-size:60px">Heading 1</h1>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 6. PARAGRAPHS ---
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

---> "HTML display"
      - You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. Large or small screens,
        and resized windows will create different results. With HTML, you
        cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your
        HTML code. The browser automatically remove any extra spaces or
        extra lines when the page is displayed.

---> "HTML Horizontal Rules"
      - The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most
        often displayed as a Horizontal rule. The <hr> element is used to
        separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

        * EXAMPLE *
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr>

      - The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

---> "HTML Line Breaks"
      - The HTML <br> element defines a line break. Use <br> if you want a line
        break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.

        * EXAMPLE *
        <p> This is <br>a paragraph<br> with line breaks.</p>

      - The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

---> "The HTML <pre> element"
      - The HTML <pre> element defines pre-formatted text. The text inside
        a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
        and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 7. HTML Styles ---
The HTML "style" attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as colour,
font, size and more.

---> "The HTML Style Attribute"
      - Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the "style"
        attribute. The HTML "style" attribute has the following syntax:

        <tagname style="property:value;">

      - The property is a CSS property. The "value" is a CSS value.

---> "Background Colour"
      - The CSS "Background-colour" property defines the background colour for
        an HTML element.

        * EXAMPLE *
        Set the background colour for a page to powderblue.

        <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
          <h1>This is a heading</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        </body>

        * EXAMPLE *
        Set background colour for two different elements:

        <body>
          <h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a heading.</h1>
          <p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a paragraph.</p>
        </body>

---> "Text color"
      - The CSS "colour" property defines the text colour for an HTML element:

        * EXAMPLE *
        <h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading.</h1>
        <p style="color:red:">This is a paragraph.</p>

---> "Fonts"
      - The CSS "font-family" property defines the font to be used for an
        HTML element:

        <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading.</h1>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>

---> "Text size"
      - The CSS "font-size" property defines the text size for an HTML element:
        * EXAMPLE *
        <h1 style="font-size":300%;>This is a heading.</h1>
        <p style="font-size":160%;>This is a paragraph.</p>

---> "Text alignment"
      - The CSS "text-align" property defines the horizontal text alignment for
        an HTML element:

        * EXAMPLE *
        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered heading</h1>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>


---> "C H A P T E R  - S U M M A R Y"
      - Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
      - Use "background-color" for background color
      - Use "color" for text colors
      - Use "font-family" for text fonts
      - Use "font-size" for text sizes
      - Use "text-align" for text alignment


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 8. HTML text formatting ---
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.

Formating elements were designed to display special types of text:
---> "HTML Formating Elements"
      * <b> - Bold text
      * <strong> - Important text
      * <i> - Italic text
      * <em> - Emphasized text
      * <mark> - Marked text
      * <small> - Smaller text
      * <del> - Deleted text
      * <ins> - Inserted text
      * <sub> - Subscript text
      * <sup> - Superscript text

---> "HTML <b> and <strong> Elements"
      - The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance. The
        HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content
        is typically displayed in bold.

        * <b>This text is bold</b>
        * <strong>This text is important!</strong>

---> "HTML <i> and <em> Elements"
      - The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternative voice
        or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

        Tip: The "<i>" tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase
             from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc ...

        * <i>This text is italic</i>

      - The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The context is typically
        displayed in italic.

        * <em>This text is emphasized</em>

---> "Other HTML elements"
      - The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:
        * <small>This is one smaller text.</small>

      - The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:
        * <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>

      - The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document.
        Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:
        * <p>My favorite colour is <del>blue</del> red.</p>

      - The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a
        document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:
        * <p>My favorite colour is <del> blue</del><ins>red</ins>.</p>

      - The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears
        half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered
        in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas,
        like H2O:

        * <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>

      - The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears
        half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in
        a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footness:

        * <p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 9. HTML Comments ---
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your
HTML source code.

---> "HTML Comment tag"
      - You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
        * <!-- Write your comments here -->

        Tip: Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag,
             but not in the end tag.

     "Add comments"
      - With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
        * EXAMPLE *
        <!-- This is a comment -->
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <!-- Remember to add more information here -->

     "Hide content"
      - Comments can be used to hide content. Which can be be helpful if you
        hide content temporarirly:
        * EXAMPLE *
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <!-- <p>This is another paragraph.</p> -->
        <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

      - You can also hide more than one line, everything between the <!-- and
        the --> will be hidden from the display.
        * EXAMPLE *
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <!--
        <p>Look at this cool image:</p>
        <img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
        -->
        <p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

        Tip: Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can
             comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.

     "Hide inline content"
      - Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code.
        * EXAMPLE *
        <p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- 10. HTML Quotation and Citation elements ---
In this chapter we will go through the <blockquote>, <q>, <abbr>, <cite>, and
<bdo> HTML elements.

---> "HTML <blockquote> for Quotations"
      - The HTML "blockquote" element defines a section that is quoted from
        another source. Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

        <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
        For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
        The world's leading conservation organization,
        WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
        1.2 million members in the United States and
        close to 5 million globally.
        </blockquote>

     "HTML <q> for Short Quotations"
      - The HTML <q> tag defines a short quoatation. Browsers normally insert
        quoatation marks around the quotation.

        <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

     "HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations"
      - The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like
        "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM". Marking abbreviations
        can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search
        engines.

        Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the
             abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.

        * EXAMPLE *
        <p>The <abbr title="World Health organization">WHO</abbr> was founded
           in 1948.</p>

     "HTML <address> for Contact Information"
      - The HTML "address" tag defines the contact information for the author/owner
        of a document or an article. The contact information can be an email adress,
        URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc...

        The text in the "address" element usually renders in italic, and browsers
        will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.


        * EXAMPLE *
        <address>
        Written by John Doe.<br>
        Visit us at:<br>
        Example.com<br>
        Box 564, Disneyland<br>
        USA
        </address>

     "HTML <cite> for Work Title"
      - The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work(e.g a book,
        a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc...)

        The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
        * EXAMPLE *
        <p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>

     "HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override"
      - The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.

      <bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>
