The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers
to display web pages correctly. It must only appear once, at the top of the page
(before any HTML tags). The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

  --- HTML headings ---
  HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most
  important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:

  <h1> This is heading 1</h1>
  <h2> This is heading 2</h2>
  <h3> This is heading 3</h3>

  --- HTML paragraphs ---
  HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag:
  <p> This is a paragraph </p>
  <p> This is another paragraph </p>

  --- HTML links ---
  HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

  The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used
  to provide additional information about HTML elements.
